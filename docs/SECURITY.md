# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a bug, congrats!
If it's a security issue, exploit it.

I'm serious. Make a PR that exploits it. >:)

I might fix it. I might not.  
This tool was never meant to be safe.


## What is considered a vulnerability?

Anything that makes the tool do something unexpected.  
Which is basically everything.  
Good luck.
