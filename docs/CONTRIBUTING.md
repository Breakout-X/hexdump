# Contributing to hexdump

## Step 1:
Don't unless you can read x86 Assembly, C99, or your mom's credit card number

## Step 2:
If you ignored Step 1, open a PR with a commit message like "I did a thing."

## Step 3:
Wait forever. Or don't. I probably won't merge it.

## Step 4:
If you actually want me to merge it, make a directory like this:
`lol/your-github-username/` and put all of the changed files in there.

Please note that if I see something that I personally do not approve of, I will not accept your PR.
Otherwise, it's a 50/50 ;)

If your PR causes my computer to catch fire, I will be impressed.
