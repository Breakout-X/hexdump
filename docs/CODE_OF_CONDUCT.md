# Code of Conduct

Be chill. Or don't.  
Just don't make me regret putting this on GitHub.

Also don't violate Github's guidelines or else I'll stop accepting PRs.

---

Violations will be punished by being assigned to maintain a copy of this repo 
called `hexhump` for eternity.  
Good luck explaining `hexhump` to your future therapist.

---

Okay if you actually violate the conduct, I'll just remove your access from the 
original repository
